His son might be named Nils Andersson. A daughter could be Britta Andersdotter (dotter = daughter). Exceptions to this include nobility and clergy. Priests would often combine Greek or Roman endings -ander or -ius to names of parishes to form new names (for example, Eric Norelius). "

It may be quaint now but we are fortunate to have factories and farming jobs available for the people. I have friends all over Illinois including Rockford and Chicago! We stay in touch through correspondence and the occasional social visit when we can. My piece of advice for you, should you make the journey, is to find peace with yourself and our loving God. For He is the way and will guide you! The Christian faith has given me hope and salvation along my journey. My fellow companions and myself attend the Lutheran service held by a pastor who is also from Sweden. It is wonderful to have familiarity in a strange place. Services are something to look forward to as it brings us closer to our Maker and builds a strong sense of community. I pray for all the success in the world for you as you make your own journey. \n\nLovingly,\n\nErika Leiffson"

		gameText: "Dear Cousin,\n\nI have been blessed to have found a place I can call home. My journeys were long, and at times I had felt grief for leaving my beautiful Sweden. I remember so clearly how it felt to be a stranger in a strange place. Only having a small trunk and broken English left me apprehensive of my surroundings. I am thankful that I have experienced no ill wills on my passage to America. I had heard some of my kin had travelled to the far west of this vast country, in a place called Washington state. My family settled near Tacoma and are now prosperous farmers and fishermen! I decided to try my hand for this place. I took the Walla Walla railroad instead of the Northern Pacific, as it was the cheaper option. I was taken to Seattle and found a boardinghouse for Swedes. Within a month I had found employment as a maid to one of the founding families. They treat me well despite some language barrier, but I am becoming more proficient and feel more confident in my new home.\n\nI do wish you well and hope someday to meet you again in my new home! Give my love to my family and friends!\n\nLinnea Parsson"

I had arrived only two months in St. Paul, working odds and ends in the town when I noticed an advertisement of purchasable land not far from my lodgings. Land is so cheap here in America! I saved enough to buy my own lot and have begun to till and grind the land. My hope is to grow peas and potatoes and sell them at market. Let us pray for a good harvest this next season!\n\nLife has treated me well. The journey is hard on everyone, harder for others. My companion on the trip to America arrived well but I have received word that he has fallen into poverty. He was swindled by a false recruiter at the docks. He is struggling to find employment in the city but, God willing, I hope he will find something soon!\n\nAs you make the journey, make sure to bring plenty of food. They treat you well on the ships and trains but the journey alone can make one homesick. A little piece of home can appease the qualms of the stomach and might make you a friend or two!\n\nGodspeed dear cousin! \n\nArvid Lothbrok"

		title: Historical Note: the Pull of America
		imageFileName: facts.png
		gameText: "Immigrants were inspired to move to America not only by \"push\" factors that pushed them to leave their country of origin, but by \"pull\" factors that suggested the United States would offer great opportunities. Many immigrants found out about these opportunities from family and friends, then they often followed those family and friends to places where they had already become established--a process called chain migration. Letters from the U.S.  to Sweden provided lots of advice about the long journey as well as information about opportunities in their new American homes and sometimes encouragement to join them. Other immigrants were recruited in Sweden to go straight to particular jobs in the United States. John Deere, in Moline, Illinois, was well known for recruiting Swedes for its growing factory operation."

		title: Historical Note: Swedish Immigration
		imageFileName: facts.png
		gameText: "Between 1850 and 1930, over 1.3 million Swedes immigrated to the United States. At the same time, over 50 million Europeans left Europe. Several factors \"pushed\" Swedes to leave their homeland while others \"pulled\" them to America. Population growth in Sweden led to less available land for farming and crop failure in the late 1860s put pressure on the agrarian society. That, paired with the availability of cheap land for farming and the Homestead Act of 1862 in the United States, caused many Swedes to seek a new life in America. Once Swedish immigrants found themselves here, they wrote letters back home describing their experiences, often in overly positive terms. These so-called \"America letters\" proved important in establishing migration channels for new immigrants to come and join their family and friends in America. Religious and political reasons played a much smaller role for the move to America, although it was critical in some cases.\n\nThis Trans-Atlantic mass exodus was one of the major events in Swedish history during the last two centuries. This immense network of contacts established across the Atlantic has influenced the ways in which Swedish society then and now is oriented towards the United States."

		imageFileName: facts.png
		gameText: "Immigrants from Sweden usually gained needed papers for travel from their Parish. Tickets were costly; $30 USD in 1880 is the equivalent of $775 USD in 2017. Forging papers was not typical for immigrants; however, one letter, translated by the Swenson Center and sent to a Mr. Hjalmar Andersson, mentions that Swedish men were drafted in the military when they turned 18. In order for these men to migrate, they needed to find alternative ways to seek passage and documentation, so the letter writer suggests pursuing a forgery."

You try to walk away but he pushes you back to the boiler. You hesitantly do as he says. He orders you to fix the gears on the pressure system when you are done. Because of your lack of engineering skills, you fiddle with the gears which causes great amounts of pressure. So much pressure that you cause the boiler to implode. One by one, the boilers catch on fire and cause the room to collapse. The ship sinks into the abyss, lost forever."

		gameText: "Arrived! You've arrived at Castle Garden in New York City. Before 1890, the federal government practiced some oversight of immigration to the U.S., but it largely contracted out the duties. The famous Ellis Island did not open as the country's primary immigration center until 1892. From 1855 to 1890, more than 8 million immigrants who arrived in New York City were instead processed at Castle Garden, America's first official immigration center, by New York state officials."

		gameText: "After authorities examined the sanitary conditions of the boat, passengers were brought from their ships on barges to Castle Garden. If medical examiners believed a migrant was likely to become a public charge, either due to disease or a perception of helplessness, then they would be quarantined until officials could arrange for deportation. Each person was individually registered by a clerk, then moved to the next desk, where transportation companies' clerks would determine where the migrant was traveling, lay out maps to view the route ahead, and figure out the price for their next stage of the journey. Immigrants would have their bags checked, pay the requisite costs, and then a steamboat would take them to the starting points for various railroad and steamboat lines."
